      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
      language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
      CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
      you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It
      describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts,
      spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however
      you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves,
      including how elements are positioned in the browser.
